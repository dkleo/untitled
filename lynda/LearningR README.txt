LEARNING R README
============================================================

This R project was created by Barton Poulson for the LinkedIn Learning course "Learning R." This R project contains three folders:

1. CODE

The code folder contains the program files for this course. In this case, it consists of R scripts for every video that uses R code. In other situations, it could contain several other formats, as well.

2. DATA

The data folder contains all external data files that are used as examples in this course. (This course also relies on several datasets from the datasets package that is part of R, so those datasets are not included here.)

3. OUTPUT

The output folder contains any images or other exportable files that result from the analyses. The images are generally saved in either PNG format or PDF format.

In addition to these three folders, the following files are contained in the LearningR project folder:

- This README file

- The LearningR.Rproj file that contains all of the project settings and links
